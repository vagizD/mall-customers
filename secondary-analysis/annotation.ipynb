    "`mall customers` dataset represents the mall owner who collected data using the ID cards of customers. The owner possesses some basic data about clients and wants to group them.

Speaking more formally, $k$ centers (different $k$ colors) are picked in $N$-dimensional space and iteratively updated while all the points being assigned to the group (color) of closest center. The process is done by computing euclidean distances $\\displaystyle \\left(d(q,p) = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{N}(q_i - p_i)^2},\\text{ q and p being points on N-dimensional axis}\\right)$.
